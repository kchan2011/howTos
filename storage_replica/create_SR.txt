The benefit of this new feature is that it is possible to create failover clusters without requiring the permission to create computer objects within AD DS. Microsoft recommends not using Active Directory-detached clusters in scenarios that require Kerberos authentication. This cluster type can also only be deployed using Windows PowerShell.

Storage Replica also supports asynchronous replication for longer ranges and higher latency networks. Because it is not checkpoint-based, and instead continuously replicates,

Thin provisioning. Support for thin provisioning in Storage Spaces and SAN devices is supported, in order to provide near-instantaneous initial replication times under many circumstances.

Thick Provision Eager Zeroed

A  type of thick virtual disk that supports clustering features such as  Fault Tolerance. Space required for the virtual disk is allocated at  creation time. In contrast to the flat format, the data remaining on the  physical device is zeroed out when the virtual
